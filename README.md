# Shark Attacks 

This is a short analysis of the shark attacks in the world, we will try to determine which countries are riskier.
-> See the iPython Notebook : [Shark Attack](Shark%20Attack.ipynb).

## Data

The data came from [sharkattackfile.net](http://www.sharkattackfile.net/incidentlog.htm) and for the size of the coastline we used the data from [wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.com/en/List_of_countries_by_length_of_coastline).
